# Installation of Visual Micro for Arduino

The following section helps you in setting up your software environment for Arduino development.

## Install Visual Studio or Atmel Studio
Visual Studio and Atmel Studio are **IDE**s, **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironments, that offer a powerful editor and integrated tools for compiling and uploading your code.
After installing one of these IDEs, we will later install Visual Micro as an extension module to these IDEs. The Visual Micro extension enables Visual Studio and Atmel Studio to compile and upload Arduino code, using the original tools in the background that you have installed in step 1.

If you are not sure which IDE to choose, read this article: [Which is the right IDE for me?](https://localhost/Getting-started-which-IDE.html "Which is the right IDE for me?")

Download the IDE of your choice (Visual Studio or Atmel Studio)


Supported Versions:
Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and higher
Atmel Studio 7.0
